I didn't receive or offer any coding help in this project.
In this final project I managed to refresh my memory on pretty much every topic we studied and learned throughout the course.
It tested my skills in terms of using the standard c++ library algorithms and functions to implement certain functionalities
in the project. I was mostly using while and for loops and more basic style of coding before we studied the standard library 
algorithms and functions but this project helped me in simplifying my code and utilizing the standard library. In this project
I also refreshed and tested my skills in file stream objects and how to read from files properly. The course material provided
in OOP345 was enough for covering anything the project needed and I didn't need to resort to any external sources to finish my
workshops and assignments. I think the OOP345 adds more functionality and depth into what I've learned in OOP244 in the previous
semester which improves my coding skills and approach.
